# site
Hi, this is a simple github repo for Fleek

To start, make sure you fork this repo, and update the index.html file with the text you want to see on the site.

To deploy, create an account at fleek.xyz, click on "Add New" then "Deploy my Site".  You simply connect your forked version of this github repo, use the default settings, and hit deploy.

Your site will be stored on IPFS and you'll get a permalink you can use to see it.

If you would like to add an ENS domain that you own, make sure you are connected to the wallet that has that domain in it, then navigate to your site and scroll down to where it says "Custom ENS".  Follow the directions and sign the transaction.  Append .limo to the end of your ENS to have your site populate in the browser.
